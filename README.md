## Summary 
Based on the data above, an ice cream/surf shop could still make a profit during these two months. Fortunately, there is not a large deviation in the weather which won't completely deter people from traveling and using these services. Although, these months may be cooler than others, ice cream purchases and surf equiptment rental sales can still be expected. Additional research can be done on the amount of people who travel to these areas during these months. December although colder in Hawaii, might be many peoples destination for the holidays.
